    <h2>Variables, Constants & Let keywords</h2>
    <p><b><u>Variable:</u></b> Variable is a named memory location, whose value may change during the execution of a program.</p>
    <p><b><u>Conatant:</u></b> Constant is also a named memory location, whose value never changes during the execution of a program.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> Constants stay constant whereas variables vary.</p>
